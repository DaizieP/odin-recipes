        <h2> Keto Friendly Pizza! Yumm!</h2>
        <p> For those of us who loves pizza but have been trying to start a keto lifestyle this is for you! This pizza alternative has all the toppings you love minus the carby bread</p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Ground Pork Sausage</li>
            <li>1 large bell pepper(cut in thin strips)</li>
            <li> 8oz Cremini Mushrooms(sliced)</li>
            <li> 1 cup Marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese(shredded)</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 oz pepperoni slices</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat an oven-safe 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add ground sausage. Cook for 8-10 minutes, breaking apart with a spatula, until browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Toward the end of cooking the sausage, preheat the oven to the Broil setting.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Push the sausage to the edges of the pan, making a space in the center. Add mushrooms and bell peppers to the center. Cook for 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally once they start to soften and moving any less cooked pieces toward the bottom, until vegetables are soft and any excess moisture has evaporated. (Add a little oil if the pan gets too dry.)</li>
            <li>Turn off heat. Pour the marinara sauce over the pan. Smooth evenly with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with shredded mozzarella. Arrange pepperoni slices on top.</li>
            <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven under the broiler. Broil for 2-3 minutes, until the cheese is melted and browned, and pepperoni starts to crisp up a little.</li>

        </ol>
